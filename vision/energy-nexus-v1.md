# The Energy Nexus

The Energy Nexus knows how much usage the machine has left, on every provider, and says so: it answers a reading, pushes each change, and sends a reminder when a level is crossed. It is the worked example of a translator: the Nexus holds only typed readings; every word of every provider's API lives in the translator.

## Operation

```ethos

[ Reading.Provider                     ; attempts

## Emission

The translator's vocabulary. Each emission is one call; the words of the call are the translator's alone.

```ethos

  Send.{ Recipient Provider Level } ]  ; flow Send.{ Address Soft.Notice }, the text composed here

```

```rust

    type Outcome = ExternalOutcome;
    fn emit(&self, t: &Translator) -> ExternalOutcome {
        t.app_server("account/rateLimits/read", json!({})) // reply → Reading, typed, by the translator

## Pace: over or under, per day

A reading alone says how much is left; pace says whether the machine is spending it as intended, and is the default answer to every reading. Each provider has a target: Even spends the window evenly; SpendBy spends it whole by an instant, as when a Codex reset is to be redeemed before it expires and the week is meant to be used up first. Pace is the comparison of what has been used to what the target says should have been used by now.

Energy is best spent in the hours it is most useful, so pace measures time in useful hours: each hour of the week counts at the usefulness its owner gave it, and an hour he named nothing for counts at the baseline. The same energy left reads lower with one day and two nights ahead than with two days and one night. Pace says how many hours the window has left, how many useful hours those come to, and what is left per useful hour: the power the machine can run at.

The schedule is its owner's: one who works every day, one who keeps the weekend, and one who has two evenings a week each say so in spans.

Where two spans name the same hour, the more specific one counts: the span naming fewer days, and between two naming as many days, the one naming fewer hours. An override counts over every span.

```ethos
Hours.Integer
Hour.Integer                         ; 0 to 23, in the owner's local time
Weekday.[ Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday ]
Usefulness.Percent                   ; what an hour counts for; 100 is an hour at full use
Baseline.Percent                     ; the usefulness of an hour no span names
Span.{ Vector<Weekday>               ; on these days,
       From.Hour To.Hour             ;   between these hours,
       Usefulness }                  ;   an hour counts this much
Override.{ From.Instant To.Instant   ; between these two instants, whatever the schedule says,
           Usefulness }              ;   an hour counts this much
```

A schedule may be drawn from the record of when its owner was most active, in place of his own estimate.

An override sets the usefulness of one stretch of time, over the schedule: a day away, a meeting, a morning he means to work hard. He sets one by hand; whatever keeps his calendar sets one as an entry is made, an event like any other.

```datom
Configure.Baseline.20
Configure.Span.{ [ Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday ] 8 22 100 }
Read.Codex
Read.{ { Codex true [ { Week 35 1795054860 10080 } ] [] 1794610200 }
       { Codex Even 25 35 Over 124 83.5 0.78 } }
; one who keeps the weekend: weekdays at full use, the weekend at the baseline
Configure.Span.{ [ Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday ] 9 18 100 }
; one who has a job: two evenings at full use, and the weekend mornings at half
Configure.Span.{ [ Tuesday Thursday ] 19 23 100 }
Configure.Span.{ [ Saturday Sunday ] 9 13 50 }
; a gradient: the hours around noon at full use, the early morning and the evening at less
Configure.Span.{ [ Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday ] 6 10 60 }
Configure.Span.{ [ Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday ] 10 14 100 }
Configure.Span.{ [ Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday ] 14 22 70 }
; an override: an afternoon at the dentist, two hours at nothing
Configure.Override.{ 1794859200 1794866400 0 }
```

```datom
Configure.Target.{ Codex SpendBy.1762450320 }   ; use the week up before the reset expires
Configure.Target.{ Claude Even }
Read.Codex
Read.{ { Codex true [ { Week 92 1762235580 10080 } ] [ { rc_1 Available 1762450320 } ] 1762210000 }
       { Codex SpendBy.1762450320 88 92 Over 48 32.0 0.25 } }
```

## The redeem rule

A Codex reset is redeemed when the provider says usage is not allowed and work is waiting, or within RedeemExpiring minutes of its expiry with the week at least 1% used; the reset redeemed is the available one expiring soonest, never a later one while an earlier stands. The rule is the Nexus's; the call is the translator's.

## Later: the Flow Nexus listens

The Flow Nexus subscribes. On Plenty it launches more and higher; on Low it launches fewer and cheaper; on Out it lets flows sleep and wakes them on Changed. What it does at each level is its own configuration, not the Energy Nexus's.

```datom
energy-nexus 'Read.Codex'
Read.{ { Codex true [ { Week 92 1762235580 10080 } ] [ { rc_1 Available 1762450320 } ] 1762210000 }
       { Codex Even 23 92 Over 120 80.0 0.1 } }
Configure.Reminder.{ Codex Low { Psyche core Primary } }
```
