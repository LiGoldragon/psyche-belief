## What memory is, long term

In the long term, memory is the database engine of a Nexus, authored in Ethos so the stored types are visible; its root, Memory, declares record types. It matters more than nexus, because operational editing should yield the migration with the edit.

```
Memory
[]                                                        ; imports
[ Lock.{ LockId LockName FlowId LockPaths LockReason } ]  ; record types
                                                          ; the remaining sections are to be decided
```

## Memory is upgraded, never accommodated

A Nexus's Memory is designed for the Nexus as it is to be; the new Nexus accommodates nothing of the old store. The old store is upgraded to the new format on open, and where that upgrade looks or proves difficult, a cheap flow reads the old store and sends the signals that repopulate the new one: the signals of a Nexus repopulate its Memory in every way.
