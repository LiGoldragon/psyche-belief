# Markdown, read structurally

Version 0 of Sema is Markdown with a typed reading. Markdown is the edge form, as Datom is for signal: text comes in as Markdown and is composed into the tree, and goes out by projecting the tree back into Markdown, one walk in two directions. Memory holds the tree and never the text.

The tree is what Markdown already has, named: a heading opens a section and its depth is the nesting; a paragraph is a statement, the unit a reviewer rules on; a fence is code in a language, a Mermaid fence a figure; a link is a reference; a list, a quote and a table are what they are. A block is placed by the titles of the sections above it.

```ethos
Library
[]
[ Document.Vector<Block>
  Section.{ Title.Text Vector<Block> }      ; a heading and what is under it
  Block.[ Statement.Text                    ; a paragraph
          Section
          Code.{ Language Text }            ; a fence; Mermaid is a figure
          List.Vector<Block>
          Quote.Vector<Block>
          Table.Vector<Row> ]
  Row.Vector<Text>
  Language.[ Ethos Datom Rust Nix Shell Ini Mermaid Plain ]
  Text.Vector<Run>                          ; inside a paragraph
  Run.[ Words.String
        Emphasis.Text
        Strong.Text
        Code.String
        Reference.{ Text Target } ]         ; a link
  Target.[ Place Url.String ]
  Place.Vector<Text>                        ; the titles above a block, from the root
  Depth.Integer
  Outline.{ Title.Text Vector<Outline> }
  Kind.[ Headings Statements Code References ]
  Pattern.String
  Edit.[ Insert.{ Place Block }
         Replace.{ Place Old.Block New.Block }
         Remove.{ Place Block } ] ]
; what is asked of a document
[ Structural.[ outline.{ [ Depth ] [ Outline ] }          ; the headings, to a depth
               code.{ [ Place ] [ Vector<Code> ] }         ; the code blocks under a section
               references.{ [ Place ] [ Vector<Reference> ] }
               search.{ [ Kind Pattern ] [ Vector<Place> ] } ; a string search over one kind
               edit!{ [ Edit ] [ Result<Document Refusal> ] } ] ]
[ Document.[ Structural ] ]
```

Reading and printing are two kinds on two types, named for what each becomes: the Markdown text becomes a Document, the Document becomes Markdown text.

```ethos
Library
[ sema:[ Document ] ]
[ Markdown.String ]                          ; the text, as it is written
[ Composable.[ compose.[ Result<Document Error> ] ]
  Printable.[ print.[ Markdown ] ] ]
[ Markdown.[ Composable ]
  Document.[ Printable ] ]
```

```datom
; outline to depth 2 of the Belief Nexus module
{ «The Belief Nexus» [ { «Signal» [] } { «Meta» [] } { «Memory» [] } ] }
; the code under one section
[ { Ethos «Signal …» } ]
; a search over headings alone
[ [ «The Belief Nexus» «Signal» ] ]
```
