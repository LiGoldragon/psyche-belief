## Name

The serialized form is called signal.

## What signal is

Signal is the messaging layer: fully binary, portable rkyv fixed
across endianness, fully typed with both sides knowing the full schema.
It is one step from the
composition, beside the text chain.

## Input and output

A Signal declares inputs and outputs.

```
Signal
[]                                     ; imports
[ Lock.LockRequest  Release.LockId ]   ; inputs
[ Locked.Lock  Released.Lock ]         ; outputs
[ LockId.Integer                       ; types
  LockName.String
  LockRequest.{ LockName }
  Lock.{ LockId LockName } ]
```

## Text and signal

The textual form is datom; a CLI actualizes it and sends signal; a
Nexus speaks only Signal.

## Meta signal

The meta signal is always present: the daemon is configured only over
its meta surface.
