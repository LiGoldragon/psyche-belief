## The CLI

The `flow-nexus` on PATH is Flow 0.54.3's ordinary client and `flow-nexus-meta` its meta client. Each takes one datom argument and nothing else, and reaches the Flow Nexus at the place its configuration names: `~/.config/nexus/flow-nexus.datom` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nexus/flow-nexus.datom` when set), `{ main }`. A missing or unreadable configuration, or one naming no place, is refused naming the file (`Missing.<path>`, `Unreadable.{ <path> <reason> }`, `Invalid.{ <path> <reason> }`, exit 2), and nothing is sent.

```sh
flow-nexus 'Send.{ { Psyche core Fable } Soft.Notice.«The build is green.» }'
```

A flow sends to the address it already knows. To learn which permaflows exist or what they are doing, it asks the cheap core flow of its own aspect, { Psyche core Sonnet }, { Mind core Sol } or { Field core Sol }, which reads the listing and answers with the few addresses that bear on the question.

## The Send input

An address names its model: { Psyche core Fable }, { Mind core Astra }. Any model stands in any aspect. The recipient is the address, written bare.

```ethos
Send.SendRequest
SendRequest.{ Address SendableMessage }   ; the recipient, then the message
Address.{ Aspect Topic Model }
Aspect.[ Psyche Mind Field ]
Topic.String                              ; an uncapitalized camelCase identifier
Model.[ Fable Opus Sonnet Haiku Astra Sol Luna Terra ]
Context.String                            ; what the living's words were about
Verbatim.String                           ; his words whole
Minutes.Integer
AnswerableTask.{ Minutes String }
RequestId.String                          ; four characters, 0-9 and a-z
SendableRequest.[ Order.String
                  Question.String
                  Living.{ Context Verbatim }   ; one saying; several are several Sends
                  Result.{ RequestId String }   ; answers the Order or Question it names
                  Notice.String
                  Task.AnswerableTask
                  Done.{ RequestId String } ]   ; closes the Task it names
SendableMessage.[ HardAbrupt.SendableRequest
                  MiddleAbrupt.SendableRequest
                  Soft.SendableRequest ]
```

The priority decides delivery. An awake recipient receives every priority at once, and HardAbrupt alone interrupts; MiddleAbrupt arrives at the next tool boundary. An asleep recipient queues Soft and is woken by MiddleAbrupt or HardAbrupt.

Text is a String, written in guillemets: «text». A text keeps its ordinary spaces. A datom holding an apostrophe is passed through a shell variable, since the argument is single-quoted.

A message is written as ordinary English sentences, a space between every two words.

Every request reaches its recipient with its RequestId, which Flow draws when it admits the Send:

```datom
[ { Sender.{ Mind core Astra } Soft.Order.{ k7ph «Review the fix.» } } ]
[ { Sender.{ Mind core Astra } Soft.Task.{ m2x9 30 «Review the fix.» } } ]
```

A Result answers an Order or a Question and a Done closes a Task, each naming the request by its RequestId. It is admitted when the request was delivered and is still open; anything else, a Result naming a Task or a Done naming an Order among them, is refused Unresolved. One answer closes a request. The Flow Nexus routes it to the sender of the request it names, whatever address the Send writes. A request whose sender is no address, the living at a shell or Flow itself, keeps its answer: the Send answers `Sent.<RequestId>` and `flow-nexus 'Answer.<RequestId>'` reads it, `Answered.{ <sender> <priority>.Result.{ <RequestId> «…» } }`.

`flow-nexus 'Remind.{ <Address> <Minutes> «text» }'` reminds that address after the minutes, `Reminded.<RequestId>`: it is sent `MiddleAbrupt.Reminder.{ <RequestId> «text» }` from whoever asked, and `Cancel.<RequestId>` ends it before then. `flow-nexus 'Queues'` reads every queue that holds something, each message with its sender and priority as it would land in the prompt.

## Examples

```sh
flow-nexus 'Send.{ { Psyche core Opus } Soft.Order.«Review the drain fix.» }'
flow-nexus 'Send.{ { Mind core Astra } MiddleAbrupt.Question.«Which revision?» }'
flow-nexus 'Send.{ { Mind core Astra } Soft.Task.{ 30 «Review the fix.» } }'
flow-nexus 'Send.{ { Psyche core Fable } Soft.Living.{ «the drain» «Fix it today.» } }'
flow-nexus 'Send.{ { Mind core Astra } Soft.Result.{ k7ph «Reviewed; green.» } }'
flow-nexus 'Send.{ { Mind core Astra } Soft.Done.{ m2x9 «Reviewed; green.» } }'
```

## The replies

                 MinutesRefused.MinutesRefusal ]
VisibleUnknown.[ Address.Address Lock.Lock Flow Key.Key ]
MinutesRefusal.[ Zero Negative Unreachable ]
```

SendAccepted with Uncertain means the message was placed in the recipient's pane without its receipt; it is not sent again.

```datom
Sent.k7ph
SendAccepted.{ k7ph 116 Uncertain }
SendRefused.Unknown.Address.{ Field verifyNoSuchTopic Haiku }   ; an address Flow does not hold
SendRefused.TopicRefused.BadTopic
SendRefused.MinutesRefused.Zero
SendRefused.Unresolved                                           ; a Result or Done naming no open request
```

## A flow's own refresh

`flow-nexus 'Refresh.{ <Aspect> <topic> <Model> }'` naming the flow's own Address answers `RefreshQueued.{ <Address> <FlowId> }` while the flow works: the refresh is recorded and carried out at its next rest, its background work ended, and until then it receives what is sent to it. A resting flow is refreshed at once, `Refreshed.{ <Address> <FlowId> }`.

## When the Flow Nexus cannot deliver

When a Send to a running flow is refused or fails, the message is typed into that flow's herdr pane by hand. Herdr lists each agent with its pane, its native session and the title it shows; the pane is chosen by the title and the session, both checked just before the prompt.

```sh
herdr agent list                       # each agent: pane_id, agent_session, terminal_title
herdr agent get <pane>                   # one pane, its session and state, checked before typing
herdr agent prompt <pane> "$text"    # the message, written as a delivered datom
```

The text is the message as a delivered one reads, with its sender, so the recipient reads it as any other:

```datom
[ { Sender.{ Psyche core Opus } Soft.Notice.«Relayed from Mind core Astra, its words: …» } ]
```

Herdr answers agent_prompted when the text is submitted. That is a submission and not a read: the recipient's own reply is the read. A recipient whose Flow address cannot deliver answers through whatever route reaches the sender, and says so in its reply text.
